My open source preamp project

Here you can find the designs for my open source Guitar Preamp circuit project. I have been simulating the circuit thus far in LiveSpice, and then creating a model of it with Neaural Amp Modeler to be able to play it in real time. So far only one of the four channels is uploaded the high gain "Meltdown" channel.

You can go to https://tonehunt.org/cosmiccrucible/72fb2a1f-e22b-4079-915f-241d1dcc4b23 to find the NAM models. I reccomend pairing it with one of my PowerAmp NAM models which are also available through my ToneHunt profile.
